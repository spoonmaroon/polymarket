# Spoon Deployment Runbook

The Python collector runbook below is retired design context. The legacy Docker
entrypoint and systemd unit now fail closed; do not use this runbook to restart
Python collection. The active read-only runtime is the Rust SDK state manager.
It is intentionally scoped to BTC/ETH 5m current, next, and next-next windows
until the warm-state path and durable persistence are stable.

Persistent data lives outside the repo at `/home/spoon/polymarket-data`.

## Time Policy

All stored timestamps are UTC. Operator displays use `America/Chicago`. Venue rule text is stored raw so ET wording from Polymarket can be audited later.

## One-Time Setup On Spoon

```bash
cd /home/spoon
git clone git@github.com:AnimeWeeb9000/polymarket.git polymarket
mkdir -p /home/spoon/polymarket-data/{raw,db,live,logs}
touch /home/spoon/polymarket-data/raw/.polymarket_archive_root
cd /home/spoon/polymarket
cp deploy/collector/.env.example deploy/collector/.env
sed -i "s/^POLYMARKET_UID=.*/POLYMARKET_UID=$(id -u)/" deploy/collector/.env
sed -i "s/^POLYMARKET_GID=.*/POLYMARKET_GID=$(id -g)/" deploy/collector/.env
docker compose --env-file deploy/collector/.env -f deploy/collector/docker-compose.yml up -d --build collector
python3 scripts/check_collector_status.py --status-path /home/spoon/polymarket-data/live/status.json --max-status-age-seconds 30 --max-price-age-ms 30000 --max-orderbook-age-ms 30000
```

## Auto Deploy

Install a cron entry on spoon:

```cron
*/5 * * * * /home/spoon/polymarket/scripts/deploy.sh >> /home/spoon/polymarket/logs/deploy.cron.log 2>&1
```

The deploy script fetches the configured deploy ref, refuses dirty server worktrees, fast-forwards only, rebuilds the Rust collector image, restarts the collector, and smoke-checks the status file.
If `deploy/collector/.env` exists, the deploy script uses it explicitly. The collector is read-only and runs Chainlink RTDS plus Polymarket CLOB WebSocket state-manager mode with `POLYMARKET_INTERVAL=5m`.

For branch testing before merge:

```bash
POLYMARKET_DEPLOY_REF=origin/main DEPLOY_FORCE=1 /home/spoon/polymarket/scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Retention

Raw data remains hot for 90 days. Do not enable deletion until compact replay tests prove 1-second compacted research tables reproduce the same as-of state for sampled contracts.

## Manual Health Checks

```bash
docker compose -f /home/spoon/polymarket/deploy/collector/docker-compose.yml ps
docker compose -f /home/spoon/polymarket/deploy/collector/docker-compose.yml logs --tail=100 collector
python3 /home/spoon/polymarket/scripts/check_collector_status.py --status-path /home/spoon/polymarket-data/live/status.json --max-status-age-seconds 30 --max-price-age-ms 30000 --max-orderbook-age-ms 30000
python3 /home/spoon/polymarket/scripts/verify_state_manager_report.py /home/spoon/polymarket-data/live/status.json
du -sh /home/spoon/polymarket-data/*
```

## Mac-To-Spoon Migration

Run this only after the CLOB WebSocket collector passes local smoke checks and the spoon deploy workflow exists.

```bash
cd /Users/goon/polymarket
REMOTE_HOST=spoon REMOTE_DATA_DIR=/home/spoon/polymarket-data ./scripts/migrate_mac_data_to_spoon.sh
ssh spoon 'cd /home/spoon/polymarket && ./scripts/deploy.sh'
ssh spoon 'python3 /home/spoon/polymarket/scripts/check_collector_status.py --status-path /home/spoon/polymarket-data/live/status.json'
```

After spoon is fresh, keep the Mac collector stopped. The Mac can still run the read-only monitor against copied files, but it should not write to the same logical data stream while spoon is the active collector.
